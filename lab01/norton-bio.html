        Aidan Norton
Hi, I’m Aidan and I’m majoring in Information Management and Technology. I’m interested in cybersecurity and web development and am looking into using these skills for some sort of government job in the future. 

My Accomplishments/Skills
SU Success Scholar
Have made the Dean’s List every semester I’ve been at school
Received the NJ State Seal of Biliteracy for my German reading/speaking comprehension
I currently serve as the Snare Drum Section Leader for the Syracuse University Marching Band

Outside of school, I am very interested in music. I’ve been playing the drums for about 10 years now, and I play in a rock band with some friends on campus. For the past five summers, I’ve worked as a camp counselor, which is something I love doing and look forward to every year. I’m also a huge marching band and drum corps nerd and will often go to competitions every summer with my friends.
