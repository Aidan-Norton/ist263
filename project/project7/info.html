                            We typically rehearse a few hours before kickoff. After the rehearsal is done, you’ll have time to grab food, change into uniform, and get ready to perform. The band will perform at the Team Walk on the quad as the football team moves past Hendricks Chapel. After that, the winds/brass/guard will depart and the drumline will put on our quad show. This consists of cadences and other exercises and is a more up close and personal experience with the fans. Then, the rest of the band will join us, and we’ll run through our pregame sequence, our halftime show, and other fan-favorite songs. After that, the band will parade from the quad to the stadium, where we’ll do our pregame show. During the game, we’ll play in the stands, and then do our halftime show. Finally, if SU wins, a small group of the band/drumline will go to Varsity Pizza for a post-game performance and free food.

                            Yes, there is an audition to join the drumline. However, this is mostly for part placement. You might not get your instrument of choice, but you will definitely have a spot in the drumline. See our <a href=audition.html target="_blank">Audition Info</a> page for more information on how to audition.

                            That’s okay! A lot of our members each year have either never marched before or have never played their instrument before. We’ll teach you how to do everything you need to have a successful season with us.

                            Band is a class that will appear on your schedule, so hopefully this shouldn’t happen. Something to keep in mind, though, is that the Drumline usually starts rehearsing 30 minutes before the rest of the band. However, we’ll be lenient if there’s a class conflict during this time.

                            It changes from year to year. This past season, we had 27 members, but we could be smaller or larger than that for a number of reasons.
