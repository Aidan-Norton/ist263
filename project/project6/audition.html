                    <p>
                        Thank you for your interest in joining the SUMB Drumline – We hope to have you with us this fall!
                        The SU Drumline does require an audition to join. However, this is only for instrument placement. You might not get the instrument of your choice, but you will have a spot in this drumline if you want one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will be doing video auditions this year. To audition, prepare the assigned music and submit it all in one video by email to Dr. Rob Bridge <a href="mailto:bridger@sunyocc.edu">(bridger@sunyocc.edu)</a>. <strong>All music must be performed from memory.</strong> Your hands and feet should be present in every video. An audible metronome should also be used. If you’re auditioning on snare drum, traditional grip must be used.
                    </p>
